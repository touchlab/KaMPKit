# iOS App Developer Setup

Not assuming anything if you're an iOS developer. You may not have the Android/JVM setup necessary to run everything.

## Install JDK

You'll need a JDK, preferably version 8. We recommend 
[Amazon Corretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/macos-install.html). Download the pkg 
installer and go through the setup instructions.

Some alternative options, if desired:

. [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/) - JDK version manager and installer.
. [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) - Alternate JDK distribution

## Install Android and IDE's

Will need Android SDK, and configure `local.properties`.

For more tool options, consider Jetbrains Toolbox and install both Android Studio and Intellij.
